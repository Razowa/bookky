            <h1>Notch</h1>
            <p> From the day when as a young girl of eighteen she succeeded to the throne she showed that a
                constitutional monarch could still have a will of her own and that her words could make statesmen
                tremble.</p>
            <p> 
                The expansion of the Prince's influence, first over the Queen, then on successive Cabinets and Prime
                Ministers, and finally on every aspect of the national life, is traced, and the importance of his
                reforming zeal is clearly brought out, particularly in its lasting influence on Victoria herself, which
                controlled to the end the more irrational elements of her character.Queen Victoria remains one of the greatest figures in British history, not simply because of the
                tremendous position which she occupied for so long, but because she was in so many ways herself an
                extraordinary character.

                From the day when as a young girl of eighteen she succeeded to the throne she showed that a
                constitutional monarch could still have a will of her own and that her words could make statesmen
                tremble.

                In this classic biography Hector Bolitho analyses the phases of the Queen's life; her childhood and
                upbringing, her all too brief married life with Albert, the years of' retirement behind the great walls
                of Windsor and the more remote fastnesses of Deeside.

                Although Bolitho calls his book ‘The Reign of Queen Victoria’, his work is essentially a record of a
                remarkable woman and her husband, their personal lives and characters, rather than a political history
                of her reign.

                It describes the childhood and youth of Victoria and Albert in alternate chapters so that the reader can
                see the two growing up side by side yet independently, and can trace the gradual evolution of their
                characters in isolation until they come together.


                Praise for Hector Bolitho:

                ‘Flowing and lively’ – Cobden Sanderson on ‘Albert, Prince Consort’

                Hector Bolitho (1897-1974) was born in New Zealand but settled in Britain, where he wrote over fifty
                books and worked as a freelance journalist. His other books include ‘Albert: Prince Consort’ and ‘A
                Penguin in the Eyrie’.

            <h1>Vintage Tales</h1>
            <p> If the names Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac, Charles Perrault and Carlo Collodi mean anything to you, then you know Walt Disney isn't the only one who left a fairy tale legacy. Long before animated films were even imagined, fairy tales were part of an oral story telling tradition, then later printed and translated. Cinderella can be traced back to China in 9th century A.D, but in the Western world, it was first printed in 1634 as The Cat Cinderella by Italian writer Giambattista Basile. It appeared in his story collection The Pentamerone, alongside the earliest versions of Sleeping Beauty, Rapunzel, and Puss in Boots.

                As fairy tales were popularized, prolific illustrators like Rackham, Dulac and Gustave Doré made their mark in collections by the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Andersen. Dulac actually wrote his own fairy books, but is best known for his contributions to traditional tales. And then came Disney, who made his fairy tale debut with Snow White and the Seven Dwarves in 1937.
